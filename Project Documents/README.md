# Project Documents

This folder is for storing uploaded documents related to the Galileo Escapement Optimization project (design notes, datasheets, reports, PDFs, etc.).

Guidelines:
- Put non-code artifacts here (PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets).
- Prefer descriptive filenames and a short README entry for important documents.
- If you want files private or large, consider using Git LFS or an external storage solution and link here.
